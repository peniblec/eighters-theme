# Eighters gonna eight

One of the reason it took me  years to move away from console Emacs is
that  I could  not find  a  theme that  was  as pleasing  as the  dumb
16-colours  one (really,  8Ã—2,  hence  the name)  that  shipped on  my
terminal.   This theme  is  an attempt  to  re-create the  experience,
sprinkling some  bold or italics here  and there and taking  cues from
other themes I liked.
