# Eighters gonna eight

One of the reasons it took me years to move away from console Emacs is
that  I could  not find  a  theme that  was  as pleasing  as the  dumb
16-colours  one (really,  2Ã—8, hence  "eighters") that  shipped on  my
terminal.  This  theme is  an  attempt  to re-create  the  experience,
sprinkling some bold  and italics here and there and  taking cues from
other themes I liked.
